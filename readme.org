* Installation
This setup is intended for an intel laptop, using WiFi only.

- Install Arch (or derivitive, also works/tested on CachyOS) using the =Archinstall= script.
- Run =$HOME/bin/bootstrap=.
- Find out if your hardware is supported by [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fwupd][fwupd]] and update your firmware if so.
- See if there's anything specific for your [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Laptops][laptop.]]
- Set =noatime= in =/etc/fstab=
- Disable [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump][core dump]].
- Copy the file ~/.config/firefox/user.js~ to the [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder][profile directory]] (after running Firefox to first create the profile!)
- Optional if you a) want hibernate to work and b) have a sufficiently sized swap partition:
   add =zswap.enabled=1= and =systemd.zram=0= to the kernel parameters.

   May also need to add =module_blacklist=intel_hid= owing to a kernel bug if using an intel laptop.  WARNING: this will disable some multi-media keys, along with the power button (although long-press to power-off still works).

   Finally, [[https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/zswap-not-enabled-despite-kernel-parameter-being-set/6942][it may be disabled by config]] in Cachy, so create this file:
   #+begin_src shell
   sudo touch /etc/tmpfiles.d/disable-zswap.conf
   #+end_src

* Changing theme
Either use the script =$HOME/bin/paper [paper|theme|both] /path/to/image= or right-click and select =Theme= on an image in Thunar (this will call the same script).

=paper= will set the wallpaper, =theme= will set the theme (based off of the image's colors) and =both= will do both.

* Screenshots

The mandatory =fastfetch= shot:

* VM Notes
Add =intel_iommu=on= to kernel parameter.

To pin VM to given cores, use the following in the VM's XML:
#+begin_src xml
<vcpu placement="static">4</vcpu>
<cputune>
  <vcpupin vcpu="0" cpuset="2"/>
  <vcpupin vcpu="1" cpuset="6"/>
  <vcpupin vcpu="2" cpuset="3"/>
  <vcpupin vcpu="3" cpuset="7"/>
</cputune>
#+end_src

Can then add the following to =/etc/systemd/system.conf= so that the host OS doesn't use those cores.

=CPUAffinity=0,4,1,5=

Note that the odd-looking numbering is because Intel number their virtual core like so:

|---------------+--------+-------|
| Physical Core | V Core | VCore |
|---------------+--------+-------|
|             1 |      0 |     4 |
|             2 |      1 |     5 |
|             3 |      2 |     6 |
|             4 |      2 |     7 |
|---------------+--------+-------|

* AppArmor
Add =lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,integrity,apparmor,bpf= to the kernel boot parameters.
Also add =audit=1= to enable auditing.

* Still left to do
  - [ ] Test that =zswap= works with the encrypted partition - seems to be automatically unlocked?
  - [ ] Install and try out [[https://mergiraf.org/usage.html][Mergiraf]] and [[https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-example][disstastic.]]
  - [ ] Look into meld - file/VC comparison.
  - [ ] See if can get lookingglass working.
  - [ ] Back to making wlogout look pretty: `wlogout -b 6`, and add a CSS "glow" (i.e. nick it from someone else's config, I've seen it somewhere....).
  - [ ] Look into Tailscale!
  - [X] Find out why the bloody spacing in WayBar and the Arch button is so fucked.
  - [X] Recopy Windoze VM.
  - [X] Find out why Emacs has stopped saving the desktop....
  - [X] Try out =nwg-drawer- as an alternative launcher.
