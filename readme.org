* Installation
- Install [[https://archlinux.org][Arch Linux]] using the ~archinstall~ script - for audio, select ~Pipewire~.

- Install [[https://github.com/Jguer/yay][yay]].

- Install ~pacman-contrib~ and run ~rankmirrors~, or, if like you live in NZ, just delete all mirrors other than NZ and you should be good to go :-)

- Set the default ~umask~ to 027.

- Disable [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump][core dump]].
  
- Update ~$HOME/bin/bootstrap~ with the drivers for your machine.
  Note that the ~bootstrap~ script assumes that you're running it on a laptop, so there may be some applications you can remove/change, or just remove entries from the ~to_install~ variable.

- Run ~$HOME/bin/bootstrap~.

- Update [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Greetd][greetd's]] command to: ~command="tuigreet --cmd Hyprland"~

- Install [[https://github.com/paullinuxthemer/Prof-Gnome][this theme]] and then run:
  #+begin_src shell
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme gnome-professional-solid-40.1
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme kora
  #+end_src

  Note that you can also set ~cursor-theme~ and ~font-name~ if required.  This is because of a [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland][known GTK3 issue.]]

- Update ~/etc/systemd/logind.conf~ and set:
  #+begin_src conf
  HandleLidSwitch=suspend
  IdleAction=lock
  IdleActionSec=4min
  #+end_src

- Find out if your hardware is supported by [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fwupd][fwupd]] and update your firmware if so.

- See if there's anything specific for you [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Laptops][laptop.]]

- For Emacs:
  #+begin_src shell
  gettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme "Emacs"
  #+end_src

- Disable watchdog by appending ~nowatchdog~ to the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters][kernel parameters]].

- Update the ~greetd.service~ file so that you (mostly) don't get bootup messages covering the login box:
  #+begin_src shell
  [Unit]
  After=multi-user.target
  #+end_src

- Tidy Thunar interface
  #+begin_scr shell
  rm /usr/lib/thunax-3/thunar-wallpaper-plugin.so
  #+end_src

* Changing theme
Either use the script ~$HOME/bin/paper~ or right-click and select ~Set as Theme~ on an image in Thunar (this will call the same script).  Note that the script lives in a world where people are generally sensible and run Emacs in daemon mode.  It also assumes that they have installed the ~ewal-*~ themes because otherwise it breaks the whole effect :-(
