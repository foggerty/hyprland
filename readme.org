Post install:
 - Enable services :: ~greetd, thermald acpid, avahi-daemon bluetooth fancontrol upower sensord lm_sensors tlp~
 - Setup tuigreet :: Edit ~/etc/greetd/config.toml~ and under ~[default_session]~ set ~command~ to ~"tuigreet --cmd /usr/bin/Hyprland"~

Then run:
~gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme gnome-professional-solid-40.1~
~gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme kora~
~gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme "Emacs"~

Reboot.

Note that you can also set ~cursor-theme~ and ~font-name~ if required.  This is because of a [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland][known GTK3 issue.]]
