* Installation
- Install Arch (or derivitive, also works on tested on CachyOS) using the =Archinstall= script.  For audio, select =Pipewire=, for networking select =NetworkManger=.
- Run =$HOME/bin/bootstrap=.
- Find out if your hardware is supported by [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fwupd][fwupd]] and update your firmware if so.
- See if there's anything specific for your [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Laptops][laptop.]]
- Set =noatime= in =/etc/fstab=
- Disable [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump][core dump]].
- Copy the file ~/.config/firefox/user.js~ to the [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder][profile directory]] (after running Firefox to first create the profile!)
- Optional if you a) want hibernate to work and b) have a sufficiently sized swap partition:
   add =zswap.enabled=1= and =systemd.zram=0= to the kernel parameters.  May also need to add =module_blacklist=intel_hid= owing to a kernel bug if using an intel laptop.

   WARNING: this will disable some multi-media keys, along with the power button (although long-press to power-off still works).

* Changing theme
Either use the script =$HOME/bin/paper [paper|theme|both] /path/to/image= or right-click and select =Theme= on an image in Thunar (this will call the same script).

=paper= will set the wallpaper, =theme= will set the theme (based off of the image's colors) and =both= will do both.

* Screenshots

The mandatory =fastfetch= shot:

* VM Notes
Add =intel_iommu=on= to kernel parameter.

To pin VM to given cores, use the following in the VM's XML:
#+begin_src xml
<cputune>
    <vcpupin vcpu="0" cpuset="4"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="1" cpuset="5"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="2" cpuset="6"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="3" cpuset="7"/>
  </cputune>
#+end_src

Can then add the following to =/etc/systemd/system.conf= so that the host OS doesn't use those cores.

=CPUAffinity=0,1,2,3=

* AppArmor
Add =lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,integrity,apparmor,bpf= to the kernel boot parameters.
Also add =audit=1= to enable auditing.

* Still left to do

Lots of theme ideas swiped from JaKoolLit's over-engineered but awesome [[https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland][Hyprland setup]] :-)
