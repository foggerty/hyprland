* BSPWM Config 'stuff' for Arch.

After installing the usual xorg and required drivers, install these via pacman:

** Basic desktop
~bspwm xshkd polybar volumeicon alacritty python-pywal xfce4-notifyd light-locker lightdm rofi gvfs gvfs-smb galculator pcmanfm firefox scrot xcompmgr lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings~

* To do
 - [ ] Find the best wallpaper possible in the entirety of possibility.
 - [ ] Find out how to make volume NOT muted at startup (it's a OS boot thing, not window manager thing).
 - [ ] Firefox startup time is still awful after a reboot.
 - [ ] Get libinput working so can swipe to change desktops.
 - [X] Polybar should have a shadow.
 - [X] Find out why Polybar's background isn't blurred.
 - [X] Add (compressed) icons and theme.
 - [X] Switch back to picom.
